User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to register and login to their accounts to securely manage their financial data.

Account Management: Enable users to add, edit, and delete multiple accounts, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, etc.

Transaction Tracking: Allow users to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, and specify transaction details such as date, amount, and description.

Budgeting: Allow users to set budgets for different expense categories, track their spending against budgets, and receive notifications when exceeding budget limits.

Reporting: Generate reports and visualizations that provide users with insights into their spending habits, income trends, and budget progress.

Data Analysis: Implement SQL queries to perform data analysis tasks, such as finding the total expenses in a given time period, calculating average spending per category, and identifying top spending categories.

Data Normalization: Apply normalization techniques, such as removing data redundancy and creating appropriate relationships between entities, to ensure data integrity and efficiency in managing financial data.

Security: Implement security measures, such as password hashing, encryption, and user authentication, to protect sensitive financial data.
Process->
- Step 1: Define Project Requirements

Clearly define the requirements for your money manager app, including features, functionalities, and constraints. Consider aspects such as user registration and authentication, account management, transaction tracking, budgeting, reporting, data analysis, and security.
- Step 2: Design the ER Diagram

 Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that models the relationships between entities in your money manager app. Entities may include users, accounts, transactions, categories, budgets, and other relevant entities. Define the attributes for each entity and establish relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
- Step 3: Plan Database Schema

Based on the ER diagram, design the database schema for your money manager app. Define the tables, columns, data types, primary and foreign keys, and other constraints. Apply normalization techniques, such as First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF), to ensure data integrity and eliminate data redundancy.
- Step 4: Create Database and Tables

Create the database for your money manager app using a relational database management system (RDBMS) of your choice, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Create the tables based on the database schema designed in the previous step. Use SQL commands to define the structure of the tables, including the CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and other relevant commands.
- Step 5: Implement CRUD Operations

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in your money manager app using SQL commands. Create SQL queries to insert new data into the tables (CREATE), retrieve data from the tables (READ), update existing data in the tables (UPDATE), and delete data from the tables (DELETE). Use appropriate SQL commands such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE to perform these operations.
- Step 6: Implement Business Logic

Implement the business logic of your money manager app using SQL commands. Create SQL queries to implement functionalities such as user authentication, account management, transaction tracking, budgeting, reporting, and data analysis. Use SQL commands to perform calculations, aggregations, filtering, sorting, and other relevant operations to implement the desired functionalities.
- Step 7: Create User Interface

Create a user interface for your money manager app to interact with the database. You can use a web-based interface, a mobile app, or any other appropriate platform based on your project requirements. Implement user interfaces for functionalities such as user registration and login, account management, transaction tracking, budgeting, reporting, and data analysis. Use appropriate technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any relevant frameworks or libraries to create the user interface.
- Step 8: Test and Debug

Thoroughly test your money manager app to ensure its functionality, performance, and security. Test various scenarios and edge cases to identify and fix any issues or bugs. Debug your code and optimize SQL queries for efficiency and performance.
- Step 9: Documentation

Document your money manager app, including the ER diagram, database schema, SQL commands, user interface design, and any other relevant details. Provide clear instructions on how to run and use your app. Organize and present your documentation in a professional and organized manner.
- Step 10: Finalize and Submit

Review your project to ensure that it meets all the requirements and constraints defined in the initial step. Make any necessary revisions and finalize your money manager app. Prepare for the final submission of your project, including all the documentation, code, and other relevant materials as required by your course instructor.
